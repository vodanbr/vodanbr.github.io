 The **VODAN Implementation Network** is one of the joint activities carried out by [CODATA](https://codata.org/), [RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/), [WDS](https://www.worlddatasystem.org/), and [GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/).
 
 The VODAN network was created under the urgent need to establish a federated data infrastructure, to support the capture and use of data for machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches and, discover significant patterns in epidemic outbreaks, both for the current situation and for future epidemics.
 
 The first VODAN project aims to collect and implement a data management of patients that carry the Coronavirus, according to the FAIR principles, making the (meta)data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Therefore making the (meta)data available for reuse in new research, monitoring and other purposes under well-defined conditions.


 

## VODAN Brazil

The **VODAN Brazil Implementation Network** was established through the efforts of teams from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ([Fiocruz](https://portal.fiocruz.br/)), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/)), [Gafrée Guinle University Hospital](http://www.unirio.br/hugg_geral) and São José Municipal Hospital. The Vodan Brazil aims to provide an infrastructure capable of enabling health units to collect and manage medical data of patients infected with COVID-19.

During the first phase of the project, a collection of patient data from each hospital is collect using the [
COVID-19 CASE RECORD FORM](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwihpanpkYbsAhXCILkGHQ7MC4IQFjAAegQIBhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.who.int%2Firis%2Frest%2Fbitstreams%2F1274888%2Fretrieve&usg=AOvVaw1Abvhm1sC0BhZ17V3nyaF0), adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Subsequently, a network of FAIR Data Points ([FDPs](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/fair-data-point/)) will be created in repositories with the data of these patients, ensuring the confidentiality and privacy of each patient based on government laws. From the FDPs, it will be possible to interoperate with each other and with other national and international data sources, allowing for wide reuse and exploration of this data in different researches.
